# Configuration file for "3215 console" driver
#

#
# Pseudo control character strings
#
# Since the 3215 console device does not have the same concept of control
# characters that a normal ASCII console has, the following settings can
# be used to specify strings of characters that, when recognized by the
# driver, will be replaced with the target control character.
#
# See "driver.conf" man page for an explanation of proper syntax.
#
# The valid property names are:
#
#     intr, quit, erase, kill, eof, eol, eol2, swtch,
#     start, stop, susp, dsusp, rprnt, flush, werase, lnext
#
# See "stty" man page for an explanation of the control characters these
# represent.
#

intr = "%c";
quit = "%\\";
kill = "%u";
eof = "%d";
start = "%q";
stop = "%s";
susp = "%z";
