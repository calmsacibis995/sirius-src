 *					   (must be preserved)
 *  BYTE  sr_name[11];			pathname sought.
 *					 Format: 1-8 character file name,

 *					 (must be non-zero)
 *  BYTE  sr_res[4];			reserved for consumer use
 *
 * Service:
 *
 * The Find protocol finds the directory entry or group of entries matching the
 * specified file pathname. The filename portion of the pathname may contain
 * global (wild card) characters.
 *
 * The Find protocol is used to match the find OS/2 system call. The protocols
 * "Find", "Find_Unique" and "Find_Close" are methods of reading (or searching)
 * a directory. These protocols may be used in place of the core "Search"
 * protocol when LANMAN 1.0 dialect has been negotiated. There may be cases
 * where the Search protocol will still be used.
 *
 * The format of the Find protocol is the same as the core "Search" protocol.
 * The difference is that the directory is logically Opened with a Find protocol
 * and logically closed with the Find Close protocol. This allows the Server to
 * make better use of its resources. Search buffers are thus held (allowing
 * search resumption via presenting a "resume_key") until a Find Close protocol
 * is received. The sr_findid field of each resume key is a unique identifier
 * (within the session) of the search from "Find" through "Find close". Thus if
 * the consumer does "Find ahead", any find buffers containing resume keys with
 * the matching find id may be released when the Find Close is requested.
 *
 * As is true of a failing open, if a Find request (Find "first" request where
 * resume_key is null) fails (no entries are found), no find close protocol is
 * expected.
 *
 * If no global characters are present, a "Find Unique" protocol should be used
 * (only one entry is expected and find close need not be sent).
 *
 * The file path name in the request specifies the file to be sought. The
 * attribute field indicates the attributes that the file must have. If the
 * attribute is zero then only normal files are returned. If the system file,
 * hidden or directory attributes are specified then the search is inclusive --
 * both the specified type(s) of files and normal files are returned. If the
 * volume label attribute is specified then the search is exclusive, and only
 * the volume label entry is returned
 *
 * The max-count field specifies the number of directory entries to be returned.
 * The response will contain zero or more directory entries as determined by the
 * count-returned field. No more than max-count entries will be returned. Only
 * entries that match the sought filename/attribute will be returned.
 *
 * The resume_key field must be null (length = 0) on the initial ("Find First")
 * find request. Subsequent find requests intended to continue a search must
 * contain the resume_key field extracted from the last directory entry of the
 * previous response. The resume_key field is self-contained, for on calls
 * containing a resume_key neither the attribute or pathname fields will be
 * valid in the request. A find request will terminate when either the
 * requested maximum number of entries that match the named file are found, or
 * the end of directory is reached without the maximum number of matches being
 * found. A response containing no entries indicates that no matching entries
 * were found between the starting point of the search and the end of directory.
 *
 * There may be multiple matching entries in response to a single request as
 * Find supports "wild cards" in the file name (last component of the pathname).
 * "?" is the wild single characters, "*" or "null" will match any number of
 * filename characters within a single part of the filename component. The
 * filename is divided into two parts -- an eight character name and a three
 * character extension. The name and extension are divided by a ".".
 *
 * If a filename part commences with one or more "?"s then exactly that number
 * of characters will be matched by the Wild Cards, e.g., "??x" will equal "abx"
 * but not "abcx" or "ax". When a filename part has trailing "?"s then it will
 * match the specified number of characters  or less, e.g., "x??" will match
 * "xab", "xa" and "x", but not "xabc". If only "?"s are present in the filename
 * part, then it is handled as for trailing "?"s "*" or "null" match entire
 * pathname parts, thus "*.abc" or ".abc" will match any file with an extension
 * of "abc". "*.*", "*" or "null" will match all files in a directory.
 *
 * Unprotected servers require the requester to have read permission on the
 * subtree containing the directory searched (the share specifies read
 * permission).
 *
 * Protected servers require the requester to have permission to search the
 * specified directory.
 *
 * If a Find requests more data than can be placed in a message of the
 * max-xmit-size for the TID specified, the server will return only the number
 * of entries which will fit.
 *
 * The number of entries returned will be the minimum of:
 *    1. The number of entries requested.
 *    2. The number of (complete) entries that will fit in the negotiated SMB
 *       buffer.
 *    3. The number of entries that match the requested name pattern and
 *       attributes.
 *
 * The error ERRnofiles set in smb_err field of the response header or a zero
 * value in smb_count of the response indicates no matching entry was found.
 *
 * The resume search key returned along with each directory entry is a server
 * defined key which when returned in the Find Next protocol, allows the
 * directory search to be resumed at the directory entry fol lowing the one
 * denoted by the resume search key.
 *
 * The date is in the following format:
 *   bits:
 *	1 1 1 1  1 1
 *	5 4 3 2  1 0 9 8  7 6 5 4  3 2 1 0
 *	y y y y  y y y m  m m m d  d d d d
 *   where:
 *	y - bit of year 0-119 (1980-2099)
 *	m - bit of month 1-12
 *	d - bit of day 1-31
 *
 * The time is in the following format:
 *   bits:
 *	1 1 1 1  1 1
 *	5 4 3 2  1 0 9 8  7 6 5 4  3 2 1 0
 *	h h h h  h m m m  m m m x  x x x x
 *   where:
 *	h - bit of hour (0-23)
 *	m - bit of minute (0-59)
 *	x - bit of 2 second increment
 *
 * Find may generate the following errors.
 *	ERRDOS/ERRnofiles
 *	ERRDOS/ERRbadpath
 *	ERRDOS/ERRnoaccess
 *	ERRDOS/ERRbadaccess
 *	ERRDOS/ERRbadshare
 *	ERRSRV/ERRerror
