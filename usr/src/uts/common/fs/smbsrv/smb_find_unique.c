 *  BYTE  sr_res[4];			reserved for consumer use
 *
 * Service:
 *
 * The Find protocol finds the directory entry or group of entries matching the
 * specified file pathname. The filename portion of the pathname may contain
 * global (wild card) characters.  The search may not be resumed and no Find
 * Close protocol is expected.
 *
 * The Find protocol is used to match the find OS/2 system call. The protocols
 * "Find", "Find_Unique" and "Find_Close" are methods of reading (or searching)
 * a directory. These protocols may be used in place of the core "Search"
 * protocol when LANMAN 1.0 dialect has been negotiated. There may be cases
 * where the Search protocol will still be used.
 *
 * The format of the Find Unique protocol is the same as the core "Search"
 * protocol.  The difference is that the  directory  is  logically  opened  ,
 * any matching  entries  returned,  and  then  the  directory  is  logically
 * closed.
 *
 * This allows the Server to make better use of its resources. No Search buffers
 * are held (search resumption via presenting a "resume_key" will not be
 * allowed).
 *
 * Only one buffer of entries is expected and find close need not be sent).
 *
 * The  file  path  name  in  the  request  specifies  the  file  to  be
 * sought. The  attribute  field  indicates  the  attributes  that  the  file
 * must have. If  the  attribute  is  zero  then  only  normal  files  are
 * returned. If  the system file,  hidden  or  directory  attributes  are
 * specified  then the search  is  inclusive  --  both  the  specified  type(s)
 * of files  and normal files  are  returned.  If  the  volume  label attribute
 * is specified then the  search  is exclusive, and only the volume label entry
 * is returned
 *
 * The  max-count  field  specifies  the  number  of  directory  entries  to  be
 * returned.  The  response  will  contain zero  or  more  directory  entries
 * as determined  by  the  count-returned  field.  No  more  than  max-count
 * entries will be returned.  Only entries that match the sought
 * filename/attribute will be returned.
 *
 * The resume_key field must be null (length = 0).
 *
 * A Find_Unique  request will  terminate  when either  the  requested maximum
 * number  of  entries  that  match the  named  file  are  found,  or  the end
 * of directory  is  reached  without  the  maximum  number  of  matches being
 * found. A  response  containing  no  entries  indicates  that  no  matching
 * entries were  found  between the starting point of the search and the end of
 * directory.
 *
 * There  may  be  multiple  matching  entries  in  response  to  a  single
 * request  as  Find  Unique  supports "wild cards" in  the  file  name  (last
 * component  of  the  pathname). "?" is  the  wild  card  for  single
 * characters, "*" or "null" will  match  any  number  of  filename  characters
 * within  a single  part  of  the  filename  component. The  filename  is
 * divided into two parts  --  an  eight  character  name  and  a  three
 * character extension. The name and extension are divided by a ".".
 *
 * If  a  filename  part  commences  with  one  or  more "?"s  then  exactly
 * that number  of  characters  will  be matched  by  the  Wild  Cards,  e.g.,
 * "??x" will  equal "abx" but  not "abcx" or "ax".  When  a  filename  part has
 * trailing "?"s  then  it  will  match  the  specified  number  of  characters
 * or less,  e.g., "x??" will  match "xab", "xa" and "x",  but  not "xabc".  If
 * only "?"s  are  present  in  the  filename  part,  then  it  is  handled  as
 * for trailing "?"s
 *
 * "*" or "null" match  entire  pathname  parts,  thus "*.abc" or ".abc" will
 * match  any  file  with  an  extension of "abc". "*.*", "*" or "null" will
 * match all files in a directory.
 *
 * Unprotected servers require the requester to have read permission on the
 * subtree containing the directory searched, the share specifies read
 * permission.
 *
 * Protected servers require the requester to have permission to search the
 * specified directory.
 *
 * If  a  Find  Unique  requests  more  data  than  can  be  placed  in  a
 * message  of  the  max-xmit-size  for  the  TID specified, the server will
 * abort the virtual circuit to the consumer.
 *
 * The number of entries returned will be the minimum of:
 *
 *   1. The number of entries requested.
 *   2. The number of complete entries that will fit in the
 *	negotiated SMB buffer.
 *   3. The number of entries that match the requested name pattern and
 *	attributes.
 *
 * The error ERRnofiles set in smb_err field of the response header or a zero
 * value in smb_count of the response indicates no matching entry was found.
 *
 * The resume search key returned along with each directory entry is a server
 * defined key. This key will be returned as in the Find protocol and Search
 * protocol however it may NOT be returned to continue the search.
 *
 * The date is in the following format:
 *   bits:
 *	1 1 1 1  1 1
 *	5 4 3 2  1 0 9 8  7 6 5 4  3 2 1 0
 *	y y y y  y y y m  m m m d  d d d d
 *   where:
 *	y - bit of year 0-119 (1980-2099)
 *	m - bit of month 1-12
 *	d - bit of day 1-31
 *
 * The time is in the following format:
 *   bits:
 * 	1 1 1 1  1 1
 * 	5 4 3 2  1 0 9 8  7 6 5 4  3 2 1 0
 *	h h h h  h m m m  m m m x  x x x x
 *   where:
 *	h - bit of hour (0-23)
 *	m - bit of minute (0-59)
 *	x - bit of 2 second increment
 *
 * Find Unique may generate the following errors.
 *	ERRDOS/ERRnofiles
 *	ERRDOS/ERRbadpath
 *	ERRDOS/ERRnoaccess
 *	ERRDOS/ERRbadaccess
 *	ERRDOS/ERRbadshare
 *	ERRSRV/ERRerror
 *	ERRSRV/ERRaccess
 *	ERRSRV/ERRinvnid
