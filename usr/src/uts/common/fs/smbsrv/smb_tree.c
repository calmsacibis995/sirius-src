 *
 * SMB_TREE_STATE_CONNECTED
 *
 *    While in this state:
 *      - The tree is queued in the list of trees of its user.
 *      - References will be given out if the tree is looked up.
 *      - Files under that tree can be accessed.
 *
 * SMB_TREE_STATE_DISCONNECTING
 *
 *    While in this state:
 *      - The tree is queued in the list of trees of its user.
 *      - References will not be given out if the tree is looked up.
 *      - The files and directories open under the tree are being closed.
 *      - The resources associated with the tree remain.
 *
 * SMB_TREE_STATE_DISCONNECTED
 *
 *    While in this state:
 *      - The tree is queued in the list of trees of its user.
 *      - References will not be given out if the tree is looked up.
 *      - The tree has no more files and directories opened.
 *      - The resources associated with the tree remain.
 *
 * Transition T0
 *
 *    This transition occurs in smb_tree_connect(). A new tree is created and
 *    added to the list of trees of a user.
 *
 * Transition T1
 *
 *    This transition occurs in smb_tree_disconnect().
 *
 * Transition T2
 *
 *    This transition occurs in smb_tree_release(). The resources associated
 *    with the tree are freed as well as the tree structure. For the transition
 *    to occur, the tree must be in the SMB_TREE_STATE_DISCONNECTED state and
 *    the reference count be zero.
 *
 * Comments
 * --------
 *
 *    The state machine of the tree structures is controlled by 3 elements:
 *      - The list of trees of the user it belongs to.
 *      - The mutex embedded in the structure itself.
 *      - The reference count.
 *
 *    There's a mutex embedded in the tree structure used to protect its fields
 *    and there's a lock embedded in the list of trees of a user. To
 *    increment or to decrement the reference count the mutex must be entered.
 *    To insert the tree into the list of trees of the user and to remove
 *    the tree from it, the lock must be entered in RW_WRITER mode.
 *
 *    Rules of access to a tree structure:
 *
 *    1) In order to avoid deadlocks, when both (mutex and lock of the user
 *       list) have to be entered, the lock must be entered first.
 *
 *    2) All actions applied to a tree require a reference count.
 *
 *    3) There are 2 ways of getting a reference count. One is when the tree
 *       is connected. The other when the user is looked up. This translates
 *       into 2 functions: smb_tree_connect() and smb_tree_lookup_by_tid().
 *
 *    It should be noted that the reference count of a tree registers the
 *    number of references to the tree in other structures (such as an smb
 *    request). The reference count is not incremented in these 2 instances:
 *
 *    1) The tree is connected. An tree is anchored by his state. If there's
 *       no activity involving a tree currently connected, the reference
 *       count of that tree is zero.
 *
 *    2) The tree is queued in the list of trees of the user. The fact of
 *       being queued in that list is NOT registered by incrementing the
 *       reference count.
