 * SMB: tree_connect
 *
 * When a client connects to a server resource, an SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT
 * message is generated to the server. This command is almost exactly like
 * SMB_COM_TREE_CONNECT_ANDX, except that no AndX command may follow; see
 * section 4.1.4.
 *
 * Client Request                     Description
 * ================================== =================================
 *
 * UCHAR WordCount;                   Count of parameter words = 0
 * USHORT ByteCount;                  Count of data bytes;    min = 4
 * UCHAR BufferFormat1;               0x04
 * STRING Path[];                     Server name and share name
 * UCHAR BufferFormat2;               0x04
 * STRING Password[];                 Password
 * UCHAR BufferFormat3;               0x04
 * STRING Service[];                  Service name
 *
 * The CIFS server responds with:
 *
 * Server Response                  Description
 * ================================ =================================
 *
 * UCHAR WordCount;                 Count of parameter words = 2
 * USHORT MaxBufferSize;            Max size message the server handles
 * USHORT Tid;                      Tree ID
 * USHORT ByteCount;                Count of data bytes = 0
 *
 * If the negotiated dialect is MICROSOFT NETWORKS 1.03 or earlier,
 * MaxBufferSize in the response message indicates the maximum size message
 * that the server can handle.  The client should not generate messages,
 * nor expect to receive responses, larger than this.  This must be
 * constant for a given server.  For newer dialects, this field is ignored.
 *
 * Tid should be included in any future SMBs referencing this tree
 * connection.
