 *
 * Please also note that in some cases, the client would not send

 * off. This will cause a minor memory leak for the share and some

 * and remained open files will be freed/closed. We will need to
 * address this problem by re-architecting user/tree structures.
 * For the time being, we will leave it till we have time.

	 * A Tree Disconnect request requires a valid user ID as well as a

	 * disconnect the trees connected using the user they just logged off.
	 * There's a problem with that behavior and the tree representation
	 * of the different contexts (session, user, tree, file...). In order
	 * to find a tree a valid user has to be provided. This means, with
	 * the behavior described above, a client would receive a negative
	 * response to the TreeDisconnect request with an error code saying
	 * ERRbaduid. That response breaks some clients. To prevent that
	 * from happening, the dispatch table indicates that, for the
	 * TreeDisconnect request, the UID and the TID shouldn't be looked up
	 * in the dispatch routine. The lookup is done here. If the user or
	 * the tree cannot be identified a negative response is sent back with
	 * the error code ERRinvnid.
