# Configuration file for the audio810 audio driver.
#
#	WARNING: This is an UNSTABLE configuration file. Its contents
#		may change at any time.

#
# Uncomment cdrom to enable the audio810 driver to use the CDROM analog
# input. 
#
# cdrom=1;

#
# play-interrupts sets the number of interrupts per second when playing.
# This affects the resolution of various things, such as sample counts.
# record-interrupts does the same for record interrupts.
#
# These may be tuned to get more accurate information by increasing the
# count. However, the larger the interrupts per second the larger the
# load on the system. So use this capability cautiously. The audio810
# driver enforces a maximum and minimum count.
#
# It should also be understood that not all interrupt rates are legal.
# The hardware is restricted to DMA buffers being allocated on certain
# boundaries. If those boundaries are violated the driver will not be
# loaded and an error message is entered into the messages log
#
play-interrupts=175;
record-interrupts=175;

#
# Uncomment reset-configuration to cause the audio810 driver's state to
# be reset to the default when the driver is loaded. Otherwise this state
# is retained across driver unload/reload cycles, but not across reboots.
#
#reset-configuration=1;

#
# Uncomment ac97-invert-amp to power down/up external amplifier. Most
# hardware does't need this property. But some devices, such as some
# Sony Vaio laptops need to set this property to 1 to correct the
# inverted polarity of the external amplifier device.
