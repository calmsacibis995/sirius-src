# sets for this driver when it is loaded. The mixerctl(1) command may
# be used to change modes on the fly.

#       mixer-enabled = 0;   <-- mixer disabled, old audio(7I) behavior

# be reset to the default when the driver is loaded. Otherwise this state
# is retained across driver unload/reload cycles, but not across reboots.
