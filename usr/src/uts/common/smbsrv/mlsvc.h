/*
 * RPC strings
 *
 * DCE RPC strings (CAE section 14.3.4) are represented as varying or
 * varying and conformant one-dimensional arrays. Characters can be
 * single-byte or multi-byte as long as all characters conform to a
 * fixed element size, i.e. UCS-2 is okay but UTF-8 is not a valid
 * DCE RPC string format. The string is terminated by a null character
 * of the appropriate element size.
 *
 * MSRPC strings are always varying and conformant format and not null
 * terminated. This format uses the size_is, first_is and length_is
 * attributes (CAE section 4.2.18).
 *
 *	typedef struct mlrpc_string {
 *		DWORD size_is;
 *		DWORD first_is;
 *		DWORD length_is;
 *		wchar_t string[ANY_SIZE_ARRAY];
 *  } mlrpc_string_t;
 *
 * The size_is attribute is used to specify the number of data elements
 * in each dimension of an array.
 *
 * The first_is attribute is used to define the lower bound for
 * significant elements in each dimension of an array. For strings
 * this is always 0.
 *
 * The length_is attribute is used to define the number of significant
 * elements in each dimension of an array. For strings this is typically
 * the same as size_is. Although it might be (size_is - 1) if the string
 * is null terminated.
 *
 * In MSRPC, Unicode strings are not null terminated. This means
 * that the recipient has to manually null-terminate the string after
 * it has been unmarshalled. Note that there is often a wide-char pad
 * following a string. Although the padding sometimes contains zero,
 * it's not guaranteed.
 *
 *   4 bytes   4 bytes   4 bytes  2bytes 2bytes 2bytes 2bytes
 * +---------+---------+---------+------+------+------+------+
 * |size_is  |first_is |length_is| char | char | char | char |
 * +---------+---------+---------+------+------+------+------+
 *
 * The problem is that some strings are null terminated. This seems
 * to conflict with the statement above that Unicode strings are not
 * null terminated, which may be a historical thing from earlier
 * implementations or it may be that different services do different
 * things. So there is an additional string wrapper with two more
 * fields used in some RPC structures as shown below (LPTSTR is
 * automatically converted to mlrpc_string by the NDR marshalling).
 *
 * typedef struct ms_string {
 *		WORD length;
 *		WORD maxlen;
 *		LPTSTR str;
 * } ms_string_t;
 *
 * Here, length is the array length in bytes excluding any terminating
 * null bytes and maxlen is the array length in bytes including null
 * terminator bytes.
