		     OpenSolaris Buildable Source

#ident	"%Z%%M%	%I%	%E% SMI"

Note: if this is your first OpenSolaris installation, please see the
currently known issues section below to see the minimum build of
Solaris Express - Community Release required to build and install
OpenSolaris.  Either an initial install or an upgrade will work,
provided you use the "Entire Distribution" metacluster.

This delivery of the Buildable Source consists of 4 or 5 pieces:

1. encumbered binaries tarball (on-closed-bins-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.bz2)
2. compiler (Sun Studio 11 is the preferred compiler, and it is free
   for OpenSolaris community members.  You can also use gcc; more on
   that below.)
3. ON build tools package (SUNWonbld-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.bz2)
4. Pre-built BFU archives (on-bfu-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.bz2)
5. source tarball (on-src-DATE.tar.bz2; numbered builds only)

If you just want to install the pre-built archives, you'll need the ON
build tools and the BFU archives.  The tar file will unpack the
archives into archives-DATE/PLATFORM/ (e.g.,
archives-20050612/i386/).  You should review Section A
(changes since the last delivery) and Section B (known issues) before
following the BFU instructions in the Developer's Reference 
(http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/devref_toc/).

If you want to build from source, you will need the source, compiler,
ON tools, and "extras" tools.  The encumbered binaries tarball contains
complete binaries (libraries, kernel modules, commands) that are
compatible with the source.  These are binaries that cannot be built
using only the source tarball for one reason or another.  If you wish
to build the kernel (or some portion of it), or if you wish to build a
complete set of installable archives, you will want the encumbered
binaries.

Currently, to obtain source, you can either download the
on-src-DATE.tar.bz2 tarball if you are downloading a build-synchronised
delivery.  Or, you can checkout from the Mercurial repository at
(please see instructions at: http://opensolaris.org/os/project/onnv/)

The buildable source contains the source for our high key-strength
crypto, known as the Encryption Kit (SUNWcry, SUNWcryr, SUNWcryptoint).
Please note that certain countries restrict the redistribtuion of
high key-strength crypto.  If you live in one of these countries,
it is your responsibility to ensure that you are complying with your
country's laws in this area.

For general questions on the buildable source, please ask on the
OpenSolaris Help discussion list (opensolaris-help <at> opensolaris
<dot> org).  For detailed comments about the code, please use
OpenSolaris Code discussion list.  Please note that the mailing lists
are configured to only allow posts via the web forum interface or from
list subscribers.
