NOTE Solaris 2.x NOTE

- The include files in this directory are kept here to track future
- changes.
- None of these files are packaged or installed; look for kernel header
- files under usr/src/uts.
- Most of the header files are used to build the daemon, but when one
- conflicts with an installed system file, the installed file is used.


README file for directory ./include of the NTP Version 3 distribution

This directory contains the include files used by most programs in this
distribution.  The ./sys directory in this directory contains system
header files used by the clock discipline and STREAMS modules in the
../kernel directory.

Note that multicast support (MCAST define) requires the header file
/usr/include/netinet/in.h for the particular architecture to be in place.
This file is constructed during the installation process in older systems;
it is already in place for those machines that support multicast ex box.
The file in.h included in this distribution is for Suns; the files for
other systems can be found in the multicast distribtutions for each
architecture separately.

If the precision-time kernel (KERNEL_PLL define) is configured, the
installation process requires the header file /usr/include/sys/timex.h
for the particular architecture to be in place. The file timex.h included
in this distribution is for Suns; the files for other systems can be
found in the kernel distributions available from the manufacturer's
representatives.
