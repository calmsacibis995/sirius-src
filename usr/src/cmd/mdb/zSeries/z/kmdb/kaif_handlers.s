/*
 * This file contains the trap handlers that will be copied to kmdb's trap
 * table.  See kaif_activate.c for the code that does the actual copying.
 *
 * The handlers have a debugging feature, enabled when KMDB_TRAPCOUNT is
 * defined, which allows them to keep a running count of the number of times
 * a given trap has occurred.  The counter is stored in the padding at the end
 * of the handler.  Write access is of course required to allow the values to
 * be updated, so KMDB_TRAPCOUNT also enables the installation of DTLB entries
 * for each trap table page.  Finally, the code in this file is copied into
 * the actual location used by the handler, so we can't perform compile-time
 * counter location calculations.  The calculations are instead performed at
 * run-time, as A) we generally already derive the table location as part of
 * the trap processing and B) simplicity is more of a concern than is speed.
