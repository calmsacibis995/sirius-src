This directory contains utilities that help port a standard perl 5.6.1 build
directory into the ON tree and patched versions of standard perl files needed
to work around build issues.

lib/ExtUtils/MM_Unix.pm
The standard MM_Unix.pm doesn't pass through the values of INC and DEFINE to
child Makefile.PLs.  In the case of ON we need INC to refer to the proto area,
so that extensions are built against the header files in the proto area rather
than those in usr/include.  This patched version of MM_Unix.pm correctly passes
through INC and DEFINE.  We can't just patch the version we ship, as various
perl extensions have variously broken workarounds for this bug.  We arrange for
this version to be picked up during the build in preference to the standard one
by setting PERL5INC appropriately in the environment before running any
Makefile.PLs.

port
This directory contains scripts and data files used to port a stock perl 5.6.1
source tree into an ON workspace.  See the README in port for details.
